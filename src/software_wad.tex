\section{Filesystem}
\doom{} barely interacts with the OS's file system. During a typical gaming session, the engine \cw{DOOM.EXE} only needs to open \cw{DOOM.WAD} in order to access its assets. Therefore, the engine does not deal with files but rather with something called lumps which are the atomic unit of a \cw{.wad} archive and its associated caching system.\\ 
 \par
 While \cw{DOOM.EXE} remained relatively stable, the asset archive kept on growing, with each new game being more elaborate than the last, as seen in the following list of \cw{.wad}s.\\

\par

Lumps are identified by a unique name made of up to eight characters (which conveniently matches DOS's filename length limitation).\\
\par
\ccode{lumpinfo_t.c}{}
\par
There were more than thirty types of lump. Those associated with maps and music followed a naming convention so they could be grouped together. Not all lumps had content, some were only used to mark the beginning and end of groups of lumps.

\subsection{Lumps} \label{wad_detailled}
The lump system is the least glamorous part of the engine, but one of the coolest in its implementation and what it had to offer to players.\\
\par
Upon starting up, it looks at every WAD archive provided and indexes every lump found into a gigantic array of \cw{lumpinfo\_t}s, cunningly named \cw{lumpinfo}.
If additional archives are provided via the \cw{-file} command-line parameter, lumps belonging to official id Software WADs (\cw{DOOM.WAD}, \cw{DOOM2.WAD},...) are added to the \cw{lumpinfo} array first.\\
\par
In the next example, \doom{} was started with the command-line:\\
\par
\fakedosoutput{dos_doom_wad}
\par
In this illustration, \cw{DOOM.WAD} is represented with only three lumps and the two additional WAD archives have only one lump each. Notice how \cw{DOOM.WAD} are listed first and how a lump name can appear several times (there are two lumps named \cw{MUSIC1}) in the index.\\
\par
\drawing{lumpsMaster}{Lump system index}
\par
Requests to the lump system are sent via a \cw{char[8]} name. The first task is to associate the lump name with an \cw{int} lump index ID. The lump array is searched sequentially in the function \cw{W\_CheckNumForName} which, in order to speed up comparison, uses a cool trick. Instead of comparing eight characters each time, it compares two 32-bit integers.\\
\par
\ccode{W_CheckNumForName.c}{}\\
\par
In the code listing above, you will notice that the index is searched starting from the end. This is done intentionally to allow modders to provide their own assets in WAD archives to overwrite id Software's lumps.\\
\par
The beauty of this system means that the original \cw{DOOM.WAD} never had to be modified or patched. Any of the assets could be overwritten -- from maps, music, sfx, to graphics\footnote{With the exception of A.I. and map names which are hard-coded in the executable.} -- with a simple command-line.\\
\par
\trivia{To differentiate official WADs from fan-made ones, the magic number at the beginning of a WAD archive was different. \cw{IWAD} was reserved for id Software, while fan-made WADs were requested to use \cw{PWAD}.}\\
\par
Once a lump location has been found, a memory block is requested from the memory allocator. The content of the lump is copied from HDD to RAM and returned to the caller. \\
\par
The \cw{lumpinfo} array is mirrored by a \cw{lump} caching system. When a lump is requested, the index ID is used to look up a \cw{lumpcache} array first (in \cw{W\_CacheLumpNum}). A non-null pointer means the lump is already in a zone block. The lump cache slot assigns itself as the \cw{user} of the memory block, meaning the cache is automatically invalidated if the block is freed. This mechanism explains the default \cw{owner} value set to 2 which means a memory block is owned but not cached (so there is no cache to invalidate upon deallocation). In figure \ref{lumpcache}, lumps \cw{0} \& \cw{2} are not in the cache and will request WAD access.\\
\par
\scaleddrawing{0.9}{lumpcache}{Lump \cw{1} is in the cache. Lumps \cw{0} and \cw{2} are not.}
\par
\ccode{W_CacheLumpName.c}


id Software explained the assets file format to a few individuals in the community. Within a month, the "Unofficial DOOM specs", describing the WAD format inside out, was online. With the format known and a way to inject new lumps, the modding community flourished.\\
\par

Some fans used the system to replace almost every aspect of the original game. These mods were known as "Total Conversions" (TCs). The most notorious of them all was named Aliens Total Conversion.\\
\par
Released in December 1994, it took Justin Fisher one year of hard work to complete. Amusingly, the result revisited the Aliens motion picture theme id Software briefly considered before going for demons.\\

 \vspace{10pt}
 Many sound effects such as doors, weaponry, and explosions were straight from the movie. Actors' lines ("let's rock!") and screams had been digitized. All demons were replaced with aliens, eggs, facehuggers and even the alien queen. The Pulse Rifle, Grenade Launcher and Smart-Gun are there and even the chainsaw was replaced with the "Caterpillar P-5000 Work Loader". Map design wasn't neglected either. Aliens TC replicated the paranoid and scary atmosphere of the movie with the first level entirely devoid of enemies!
